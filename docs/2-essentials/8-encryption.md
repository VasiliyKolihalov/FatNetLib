# Encryption

To guarantee the privacy of packages sent over the network, `FatNetLib` has an included encryption mechanism.
It is added by `ServerEncryptionModule` and `ClientEncryptionModule`, which are built into the standard
modules `DefaultServerModule` and `DefaultClientModule`.
The ECDH (Elliptic curve Diffie–Hellman) standard is implemented.
During initialization, the P-521 curve is applied in asymmetric encryption.
After initialization, the packages are encrypted with the AES-256 algorithm.

Encryption in `FatNetLib` consists of these stages:

1. The client connects to the server. Initializers are called in unencrypted mode.
2. The client calls `fat-net-lib/encryption/public-keys/exchange` from the server.
3. The server generates its own private and public key pair.
4. The server calls `fat-net-lib/encryption/public-keys/exchange` from the client, adding its public key to the request.
5. The client generates its own private and public key pair.
6. The client generates a shared symmetric key from its private key and the server public key.
7. The client in response to the `/fat-net-lib/encryption/public-keys/exchange` call returns its public key.
8. The server generates a shared symmetric key from its private key and the client's public key.
9. Both sides include encryption.
   All outgoing packages will be encrypted with a common symmetric key.
   All incoming packages will be decrypted with a common symmetric key

## Working with `ServerEncryptionModule` and `ClientEncryptionModule`

Encryption modules add two middleware encryption modules, the order of which needs to be configured. It is important to
remember that encryption middleware works with serialized packages. Consider an example. Used together
with `JsonModule`.

```c#

var builder = new FatNetLibBuilder
{
     Modules =
     {
         new DefaultServerModule(),
         new JsonModule(),
     },
     SendingMiddlewaresOrder = new[]
     {
         typeof(JsonSerializationMiddleware),
         typeof(EncryptionMiddleware)
     },
     ReceivingMiddlewaresOrder = new[]
     {
         typeof(DecryptionMiddleware),
         typeof(JsonDeserializationMiddleware),
     }
};
```

After setting the order execution of middleware, the package will first be decrypted and then deserialized.
And the outgoing package will be serialized and then encrypted.
If you change the order of calling initializers, 
it is recommended to set up the invocation of encryption initializers as early as possible.
For earlier initializers, the increasing counters `maxNonEncryptionPeriod` and `maxNonDecryptionPeriod` were introduced. 
They need to be made as small as possible
