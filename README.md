FatNetLib is a network framework for building client-server applications using the UDP protocol.
FatNetLib was conceived for use in gamedev and Unity, but can be freely used in other
areas.
FatNetLib has familiar features and concepts from large enterprise frameworks (ASP.NET core, Spring etc.).
FatNetLib uses the [LiteNetLib](https://github.com/RevenantX/LiteNetLib#litenetlib) for transport.

**Attention, this is a beta version.
The basic functionality is implemented, but there may be problems with thread-safety.
If you encounter any problems, please let us know.**
